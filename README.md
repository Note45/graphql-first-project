# School Organizer(My first GraphQL Project)
This project aims to be a graphql backend that stores the information of students and staff of a school. This project is a simplified version of this idea, so I was able to study the concepts of GraphQL technology on top of this idea.

This project was created during the video classes of the [GraphQL course: building an API with Apollo Server](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/graphql-construindo-api-apollo-server)
